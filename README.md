Python library I built in high school intended to simplify basic linear algebra operations including matrix addition, multiplication, gaussian elimination etc. 
Designed to be scalable to accommodate determinants and eigenvalues/vectors in the future. 
This is a very basic project and I made it very early in my programming journey when I had very little understanding of programming, linear algebra or source control standards. As such, there is lots of room for improvement and it is by no means a complete project. Possible improvements in the future include the addition of a GUI and the computational accomodations listed above. Obviously this project is very basic and the code isn't great but I was proud of myself at the time and wanted to upload it for the sake of continuity.

To use: 
  1) Set up Python environment and import the two .py modules
  2) Enter UI module function calls via terminal
  3) Realize that it would have been quicker to just do everything by hand
