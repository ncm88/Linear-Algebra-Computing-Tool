Python library I built in high school intended to simplify basic linear algebra operations including matrix addition, multiplication, gaussian elimination etc. 
Designed to be scalable to accommodate determinants and eigenvalues/vectors in the future. 
This is a very basic project and I made it very early in my programming journey when I had very little understanding of programming or source control standards. 
As such, there is lots of room for improvement and it is by no means a complete project. Possible improvements in the future include the addition of a GUI and 
methods to accomodate eigenvalues/vectors/functiuons.
